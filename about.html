                    IN DESIGN AND ENERGY BY THE 1980'S NYC GRAFFITI, ART, AND
                    MUSIC SCENE. THE MENUS FEATURE RIFFS ON CLASSIC
                    COCKTAILS, AN EXTENSIVE WINE PROGRAM, AND ELEVATED BAR
                    FOOD.
                    THE SPACE THAT CHANNELS THE EDGINESS OF 80’S NYC.
                    DESIGNED BY JASON VOLENEC OF VOLENEC STUDIO (BODEGA
                    NEGRA, MISS LILY’S, BUTTERFLY), THE 50-SEAT SPACE
                    INCORPORATES RAW, NOSTALGIC ELEMENTS MEANT TO EVOKE
                    THE BYGONE ERA - THINK A BLACK AND SILVER CHECKERBOARD
                    CEILING AND ORIGINAL FLYERS FROM PUNK AND HIP-HOP
                    SHOWS AND A BEAUTIFUL PIECE BY THE FAMED ARTIST OF THAT
                    ERA, MARIPOL, FEATURING POLAROIDS OF BASQUIAT IN HIS

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>
                        AT THIEF NYC, OUR MISSION IS TO SAFEGUARD AND
                        CELEBRATE THE ENDURING ALLURE OF NEW YORK CITY,
                        BLENDING ITS TIMELESS GRIT AND CHARM WITH
                        CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE. WE ARE DEDICATED TO
                        SHARING THIS CAPTIVATING ESSENCE WITH GUESTS
                        NATIONWIDE, ENCAPSULATING OUR FAVORITE ELEMENTS
                        THAT MAKE THE CITY SO IRRESISTIBLY ENIGMATIC.
                        FROM THE VIBRANT STREET ART CULTURE TO THE
                        PULSATING UNDERGROUND MUSIC SCENES, WE ASPIRE TO
                        HARMONIOUSLY AMALGAMATE THE CULTURAL
                        MOVEMENTS THAT HAVE DEFINED THIS CITY. OUR GOAL IS
                        TO TRANSFORM THE URBAN EXPERIENCE INTO A VIBRANT,
                        SEVEN-DAY-A-WEEK, LIVING ENTITY WITHIN THE
                        CONFINES OF OUR FOUR WALLS. MUCH LIKE THE SEISMIC
                        CULTURAL SHIFTS SPARKED BY NYC'S ART AND
                        CREATIVITY, WE ENVISION THIEF NYC AS MORE THAN
                        JUST A PROVIDER OF CRIMINALLY GOOD FOOD AND
                        DRINKS. WE BELIEVE IT IS A CATALYST FOR INSPIRATION,
                        TRANSCENDING GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES, AND
                        LEAVING AN INDELIBLE MARK ON THE HEARTS AND MINDS
                        OF ALL WHO ENCOUNTER IT.
                    </p>
                <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                <p>AT THIEF NYC, OUR VISION IS TO BE THE MODERN-DAY ARCHITECTS OF URBAN TRANSFORMATION, DRAWING
                    INSPIRATION FROM OUR WILLIAMSBURG FLAGSHIP LOCATION AND TAKE THE CHANCE TO EMBRACE THE
                    OPPORTUNITY TO CULTIVATE A MULTINATIONAL BRAND THAT IDENTIFIES UNMET NEEDS AND FILLS THEM WITH
                    INNOVATION. THIEF NYC IS NOT JUST A HAVEN FOR CITY-DWELLERS; IT'S A BEACON FOR MAJOR
                    METROPOLISES SEEKING INSPIRATION FROM THE VIBRANT HEART OF NEW YORK.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>WE POSSESS AN UNQUENCHABLE THIRST TO BOTH PRESERVE AND PROVIDE THE GRITTY AND CHARMING
                    ASPECTS OF NEW YORK, PAST AND PRESENT. THINK OF US AS TODAY'S BENEVOLENT BANDITS, DEVOID OF
                    CRIMINAL INTENT. WE COLLECT THE FRAGMENTS OF URBAN LIFE, CURATE THEM WITH CARE, AND CULTIVATE
                    THE ESSENCE OF WHAT MAKES THE CONCRETE JUNGLE PULSE. AS THE MODERN-DAY ROBIN HOOD OF CITIES,
                    WE SPREAD THE WEALTH OF INSPIRATION, INNOVATION, AND CULTURAL RICHNESS, ENSURING THAT THIEF
                    NYC IS THE CONDUIT FOR URBAN EVOLUTION, A TREASURE TROVE OF IDEAS, AND A BEACON OF PROGRESS
                    FOR CITIES WORLDWIDE.</p>
